# MobileCourse




Welcome to -APP_NAME(TBD)- 
===================

I was inspired to make this app because of my undergraduate experience as a CS student. There was no way to hold students accountable when they did not complete their assigned tasks in group projects. Many college students are practicing something similar to the "SCRUM" model but it is done inefficiently. I came to realize that every two weeks in school when you were assigned a new program, it is similar to the concept of a "Sprint". Due to the lack of project management, poor breakdown of tasks and lack of SCRUM meetings, students do not feel the "truth-seeking" pressure from SCRUM meetings and efficent task management. Hence, I created APP_NAME to help developers/student developers to bring SCRUM into their workflow, either in the classroom or for personal projects.
